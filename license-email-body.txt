Hi,

thank you for buying jsreport!


To attach license to your jsreport server please download the attachment license-key.txt and copy it to your jsreport working directory.
You can also provide the key in the command line parameter "--license-key=xxx" when starting jsreport. Then enjoy using jsreport without any limitations.

Please use jsreport.net@gmail.com for support questions and incidents.
