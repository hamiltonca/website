Today I am releasing jsreport 0.6 which mainly includes new [client-app extension](/learn/client-app). This extension lets you bring jsreport into all kind of devices in form of an easy html based reports browser.

Just update jsreport, navigate to [https://jsreport-host/client](/learn/client-app) and the new application designed for reports' end users should pop up.

The application is customizable through standard jsreport templates which makes easy for you to create new report dashboards or portals for the end users. Check the [documentation](/learn/client-app) and give it a try.
