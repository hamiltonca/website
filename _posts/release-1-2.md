This release mainly adds support for `rowspan` and `colspan` into [html-to-xlsx](/learn/html-to-xlsx) recipe. Additionally you can also find some UI improvements as well as bug fixes in the recent release.

##rowspan and colspan

This works as you would expect in the same way as in html. Just specify `rowspan` and `colspan` attributes in the cells and the recipe makes sure to merge cells into the specified structure.
