I'm happy to announce the new extension in jsreport family which adds support for versioning changes in templates and all other jsreport entities. 

The [version-control](/learn/version-control) extension adds well known commands like commit, revert or checkout right to the jsreport studio. It can use our native javascript implementation or even local git on behind. See the [documentation](/learn/version-control) for details.

Happy Christmas
