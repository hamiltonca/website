jsreport 2.5.0 is now live. <br>
You can find the full details and relase notes in the [github releases](https://github.com/jsreport/jsreport/releases/tag/2.5.0) as always. 

The primary goal of this release was to bring better source code editor to the jsreport studio. The studio now uses the same editor component which is used in the [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). This component called [monaco editor](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor) brings modern experience to writing code now also to the jsreport. You can now experience better code completition, errors highlighting or even linting your code with [eslint](https://eslint.org/).
