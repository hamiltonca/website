jsreport is getting significantly more attention and my mail box is getting overwhelmed by questions as well as me answering them. I was recommended to create a forum and I am doing so. jsreport has now a forum as well as a mailing list hosted on google groups. Please don't hesitate to post questions there as well as feature suggestions.

If you think you found a bug you can directly submit an issue into a proper github repository. The main repositories are

- jsreport main - https://github.com/jsreport/jsreport
- node.js client - https://github.com/jsreport/nodejs-client
- .net client - https://github.com/jsreport/net 
- visual studio tools - https://github.com/jsreport/vstools

You can also ask question on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) if you think it has global interest. Just mark it with jsreport tag.

I am also still open to your questions and suggestions on my email or twitter. See [about](https://jsreport.net/about).
