A week ago we revealed the preview of the new jsreport studio. The public response was so great that we decided to migrate the playground into it right away.  So today I'm announcing that this huge upgrade for the jsreport fiddling tool known as playground is live.

Additionally we added embedding functionality similar to what CodePen has. We will mainly use it for jsreport interactive documentation, but you can use it as well.
