# Images extension

`Images` is very simple but very handy extension. Business reports very often contain static images like company logos, themes, headers, footers and others. It's possible to reference image from any web based provider like `skydrive` or `dropbox`, but it is not very efficient to download same pictures every time you are rendering a report. That's why jsreport ships with `Images` extension.

You can easily upload image from the actions menu.

When you have uploaded image, you can insert it to the any template. The easiest way is to read the instructions that will popup when you will hit `Insert into template` from the toolbar.
